##    Description

This is my contribution to the FED1 program. In this project we had to use all the skills we have learned this school year. We had to show our ability to interpret a brief, plan our solutions, design a user interface, build and test a responsive web application. CSS and JS frameworks were not allowed. We had to build the project with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The brief says to build a front-end user interface for an existing API blogging application. The website has to be responsive and allow users to view dynamic blog posts. We had to make our own account to act as the owner. We could create our own fictional client for the project, with a theme, backstory and branding of our choosing. I decided to use the example client, HotView Labs. We had to fulfil user stories for all the pages that were required:

# Sitemap:
Client requirement pages

. /index.html(Blog Feed Page)

. /Post/index.html(Blog Post Public Page)

. /Post/edit.html(Blog Post Edit Page)

. /Post/create.html(Blog Post create Page)

. /account/login.html(Account login Page)

. /account/register.html(Account Register Page)



## Client Requirements:
The goal is to design and built a responsive application that allows the user to view dynamic blog posts.Some functionality includes:

.Abanner carousel(with 3 latest posts)

.A grid of 12 posts

.Login ang Register

.Create, Edit,or Delete post(when admin login)
