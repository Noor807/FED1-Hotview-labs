## 📖 About the Project

This project is part of the **FED1 Program at Noroff**.  
The goal was to interpret a client brief, plan solutions, design a user interface, and build a **fully responsive web application** — **without using any CSS or JS frameworks**.  

The application consumes an **API-based blogging system**, allowing users to browse posts and admins to manage content.  
I designed my fictional client, **HotView Labs**, with a unique theme, backstory, and branding.  

**Key Highlights:**  
- ✔️ Fully responsive layout  
- ✔️ Dynamic blog posts via API  
- ✔️ CRUD functionality for admins  
- ✔️ Modern and intuitive UI
