#                         HotView Labs

## Description

This is my contribution to the **FED1 program**. In this project, we applied all the skills learned during the school year. The goal was to interpret a brief, plan solutions, design a user interface, build, and test a **responsive web application**. **CSS and JS frameworks were not allowed**, so the project was built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

The brief required building a front-end interface for an existing **API-based blogging application**. The website had to be responsive and allow users to view **dynamic blog posts**. We created our own accounts to act as owners and could invent a fictional client with its own **theme, backstory, and branding**. I chose to use the example client: **HotView Labs**.  

We fulfilled the required **user stories** for all pages.
